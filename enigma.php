 /**
  * Class Enigma
  * The Enigma class is a simplified representation of the Enigma machine, a cipher device used by the
  * Germans during World War II. 
  *
  * @property array $rotors
  *     An array representing the rotors in the Enigma machine. Each rotor is an integer that determines
  *     how much to shift a character.
  *
  * @property int $reflector
  *     An integer representing the reflector in the Enigma machine. The reflector determines how much to
  *     shift a character after it has passed through all the rotors.
  *
  * @method __construct($rotors, $reflector)
  *     The constructor method. It initializes the rotors and reflector properties with the given arguments.
  *
  * @method rotate()
  *     A private method that rotates the rotors by one position. This method is called after each character
  *     is ciphered or deciphered.
  *
  * @method cypher($input)
  *     This method takes a string as input and returns the ciphered text. It passes each character of the
  *     input through the rotors and the reflector, shifting it by the corresponding amounts. After each
  *     character, the rotors are rotated by one position.
  *
  * @method decypher($input)
  *     This method takes a string as input and returns the deciphered text. It reverses the operations
  *     of the cypher method, passing each character through the rotors and the reflector in the opposite
  *     order and direction.
  *
  * Please note that this is a very simplified version of the Enigma machine and doesn't include many of its
  * features, such as the plugboard, multiple rotor sets, or double stepping of rotors. Also, this code
  * doesn't provide any real security, it's just for illustrative purposes. For real encryption, consider
  * nusing established libraries and algorithms.
  *
  * Remember to handle edge cases and errors in your actual code. For example, this code assumes that the
  * input is always uppercase and doesn't contain any characters other than A-Z. If your input may be
  * different, you'll need to add code to handle that. You might also want to add error checking to make
  * sure the rotors and reflector arguments to the constructor are valid.
