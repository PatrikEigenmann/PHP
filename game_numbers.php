 * numbers.php - In this game, the program first generates a random number between 1 and 100. Then it
 * enters a loop where it asks the user to enter their guess. If the user’s guess is too high or too
 * low, it tells them so and asks for another guess. If the user’s guess is correct, it congratulates
 * the user and ends the game. The game also counts the number of tries it took for the user to guess
 * the number correctly. If the user enters something that’s not a number, the program will ask for
 * a valid number.
